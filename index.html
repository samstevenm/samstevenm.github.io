        <h1>Hi there, I'm Sam Myers!</h1>
<p>I currently work in the lighting control industry. I started in 2015 as a Field Service Engineer, after completing six years in the United States Submarine Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program. As a Field Service Engineer, I managed the commissioning of campus wide commercial lighting management systems, as well as other smaller control systems. In 2016, I took on a broader role, managing quality, training and service for our newest lighting control system. I coordinate with sales groups, engineering teams, and the field to ensure quality in design, training and service. I use my technical skills, field service experience and information technology background, to support Lighting Representatives, Union Apprenticeship Training Centers (JATCs) and contractors.<a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a></p>
